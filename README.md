# Reasonable-years
This is a mod for Civilization 6. You may be interested in the mod if you like the game.

Do you play on more then average difficulty calmly?

Maybe you even beat Diety on a regular basis?

In either case you may have noticed some discrepancy: you can easily into space in... 1860 AD.

Unrealistic, isnt it? Not anymore!
Whith reasonable years game turns will correlate more reasonable with years shown.
As you will see later, for the same % of gamelenght in turns there will be more years passed.
For example, what was year 1944 in vanilla - will be 2010 in modded game.

A brief comparasion of year/turn relation (for a standard gamespeed) is in the graph:

This is "cosmetic" change and doesn't alter gameplay in any shape or form.
