# Reasonable-years
This is mod for Civilization 6. You may be interested in the mod if you like the game.

Do you play on more then average difficulty calmly?
Maybe you even beat Diety on a regular basis?
In either case you may have noticed some discrepancy: you can easely into space in... 1860 AD.
Unrealistic, isnt it? Not anymore! Whith reasonable years game turns will correlate more reasonable with years shown.
This is "cosmetic" change and doesn't alter gameplay in any shape or form.
